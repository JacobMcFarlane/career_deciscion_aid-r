# Reflection of the Worked Done and Goals Achieved in Milestone 4

In this milestone, all of the dashboard´s features have been implemented. The current app filters the survey by country, years of experience, and job title, given the user all the information he/she requires for his decision making. Currently, the app has an untroubled usage. In this milestone, the following features were added:

* A sidebar for a better aesthetic and a better understanding of the layout.
* A collapse button that reveals important information regarding the purpose of the dashboard.
* A footer for professionalism.
* A table of the proportion of yearly incomes to enhance the information returned.
* A dropdown to filter by country.


## Decision between R and Python:

After examining the experiences inculcated from milestones two and three, we concluded that Python is the most functional language when using Dash. The documentation and help forums are more understandable and wide, the debug functionality has no bugs, the usage of lists and dictionaries feels more natural, and the deployment in Heroku is much more straightforward. Nonetheless, because Milestone 3, which contained much more valuable feedback than the work delivered in Milestone 2, was submitted in R, we chose R as our selected programming language for layout development. If we had not obtained sufficient knowledge throughout the program to feel comfortable with R, Python would have been the obvious choice.

## TA Feedback and Overall and Recurring Topics:

As suggested in the feedback provided by our TA, we:

* Corrected the page wideness (feedback from milestone 2).
* Improved the layout by adding a sidebar, avoiding the squareness in the layout and the incorrect placement of widgets (feedback from milestone 2 and 3).
* Added the filter by country option (feedback from milestone 2).
* Removed the salary card displayed at the bottom for a table instead (feedback from milestone 3).
* Figure titles were fixed (feedback from milestone 3).

## Useful tips for Developing a Dashboard:

Some outstanding insights we have obtained when developing a dashboard are:

* Stick to one programming language from beginning to end, as many interactive features are not easily interchangeable between R and Python.
* If you are new to Dash, unless you possess a considerable amount of experience in R, it is better to develop in Python. The documentation is much clearer and the debugging and deployment issues are solved faster.

  
## Limitations and Goals

Our greatest limitation when developing the app variety-wise was our dataset, as this Kaggle survey did not include any continuous variables that allowed us to create more creative and interactive plus. Nonetheless, we took this as an advantage to make an easy-to-use and very informative Dashboard. The main objective of identifying salary and programming tendencies depending on certain features like job title, level of education, and country of precedence,  was achieved. 

From this dashboard, the following in-field conclusions were obtained:
1. Python is currently the most used programming language.
2. Linear and Logistic Regression is still the most used procedures regarding Machine Learning, 
3. Most Data Scientists have or are planning to obtain a master´s degree in the next two years.
